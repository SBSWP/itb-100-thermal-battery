## üî¨ Validation Testing Protocol

If you're building a test unit, here's what we need to validate:

### Critical Metrics

1. **SAT Chemistry Stability**
   - Cycle count before degradation
   - Visual appearance after 50+ cycles
   - DSC measurement of latent heat capacity
   - Phase separation behavior

2. **Nucleation Reliability**
   - Success rate (%) over 50 attempts
   - Electrode voltage and current
   - Time to crystallization after trigger
   - Any auto-nucleation events

3. **Thermal Performance**
   - Measured UA value (W/K)
   - Power output vs. time profile
   - Charge and discharge efficiency
   - Temperature uniformity

4. **Mechanical Durability**
   - Pouch integrity after cycling
   - Aluminum plate corrosion
   - Thermal epoxy bond strength
   - Pressure vessel integrity

### Data Collection

**Minimum data to collect:**
- Temperature sensors: SAT bulk, plate surface, water inlet/outlet
- Flow rate: Constant or measured
- Time stamps: Charge start/end, discharge start/end
- Ambient conditions: Room temperature
- Cycle count: Total number of charge/discharge cycles

**Preferred data collection:**
- High-frequency logging (1 sample/minute)

- Note any anomalies or manual interventions

**Share your data:**
```
