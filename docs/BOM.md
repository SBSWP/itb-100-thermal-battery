Notes:

Aluminum plates: Consider getting quotes from local metal suppliers for bulk discount (52 plates)
Alternative: Laser cutting service (SendCutSend.com) may be cheaper for precise hole placement (~$15/plate)
Thermal epoxy: Arctic Alumina rated to 180°C, thermal conductivity 7.5 W/m·K
SS316L tubing: Flexible/annealed type for easy bending, not rigid pipe

Notes:

HDPE sheets: Buy two 4'×8' sheets, yields 51+ frames with minimal waste
Alternative to water jet: Cut frames yourself with jigsaw + template (adds labor, reduces cost by ~$100)
Threaded rods: 600mm length accounts for 416mm stack + 2× end plates + nut stacks
Consider stainless steel rods for corrosion resistance in humid freezer environment (+$15 total)

Notes:

SAT: Bulk pricing improves significantly above 200kg - contact suppliers for quotes
Alternative SAT source: Recrystallized "hot hand" warmers (tedious, not recommended for 227kg)
Na-PMAA: Critical for preventing phase separation - DO NOT SKIP
Pouch material: WVTR <0.1 g/m²/day is mandatory (verify aluminum layer present)
Sealing: Practice on water-filled pouches before using expensive SAT mixture
Consider renting commercial heat sealer (~$50/week) for better seal quality


4. Nucleation & Control System ($145)

Notes:

Silver wire: Forms electrodes inside each pouch (2× 8cm strips per pouch)
Each pouch needs electrode pair embedded during filling
1.5V DC is sufficient for nucleation - higher voltage unnecessary and dangerous
Wire routing: Run through spacer frame channels to keep organized
Consider adding current-limiting resistor (10Ω, 5W) for safety

Notes:

Pump: Size for ~5 GPM at 5 ft head (matches your 4.4 L/min calculated flow)
PEX: Use PEX-A (expansion type) for better freeze resistance if using glycol
Glycol: Optional if system is always heated, but provides insurance
Expansion tank: Accommodates thermal expansion of water loop
Pressure relief: Safety device - set below any component's max rating

Notes:

Freezer: Look for sales - often $180-200 during holidays
Manual defrost type preferred (no auto-defrost cycling that wastes energy)
Bulkhead fitting installation: Drill 1" holes low on short side of freezer
Seal bulkheads with polyurethane foam on exterior, silicone on interior
Add extra top insulation to compensate for heat loss through lid

COST OPTIMIZATION OPTIONS
If $3,500 exceeds budget, consider these value-engineering options:
ChangeSavingsImpact on PerformanceSelf-cut HDPE frames (no CNC)-$128None (just adds labor)Smaller capacity (26 plates instead of 52)-$95050% capacity reduction (8.4 kWh)Used chest freezer (Craigslist)-$120NoneSingle manifold instead of dual-$150~5% power reduction, uneven temp distributionSkip glycol (if no freeze risk)-$60Slight risk if heating failsDIY pouch material (mylar + heat seal)-$80Higher leak risk
Realistic "budget build" target: $2,800 (with self-cut frames and used freezer)
