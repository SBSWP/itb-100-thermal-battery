## üí° Notes for Content Creators

### Writing Style Guidelines

**Tone:**
- Conversational but professional
- Assume reader is smart but not an expert
- Err on side of over-explaining
- Use examples and analogies

**Structure:**
- Start with "why" (context) before "how" (procedure)
- Use numbered lists for sequences
- Use bullet lists for options/features
- Include diagrams for complex concepts

**Safety:**
- Always lead with safety warnings
- Use ‚ö†Ô∏è emoji for warnings
- Explain *why* something is dangerous (not just "don't do this")
- Provide safe alternatives

### Documentation Templates

All docs should include:
- Title (clear, descriptive)
- Introduction paragraph (what, why, who)
- Table of contents (if >2 pages)
- Main content (well-structured)
- Related links (see also...)
- Last updated date
