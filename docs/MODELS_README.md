## üîß Modifying Models

### Change Location (System Model & Heat Pump Analysis)

Edit location data in each file:

**itb100_system_model.py (line ~833):**
```python
location_data = {
    'name': 'Your City, State',
    'heating_degree_days': 5000,  # Your HDD
    'avg_winter_temp': 0.0         # ¬∞C
}
```

**heat_pump_assist_analysis.py (line ~63):**
```python
@dataclass
class ShoulderSeasonConditions:
    spring_avg_temp_F: float = 45.0  # Your spring temp
    fall_avg_temp_F: float = 50.0     # Your fall temp
    # ... etc
```

### Change Economic Assumptions

**Electric rates (heat_pump_assist_analysis.py, line ~285):**
```python
electric_rate = 0.18  # Change to your peak rate ($/kWh)
```

**Carbon pricing (line ~276):**
```python
carbon_value = (carbon_avoided_kg / 1000) * 50  # Change 50 to your $/ton
```

### Add Uncertainty Analysis

Models currently show single-point estimates. To add uncertainty:

1. Define parameter ranges
2. Run Monte Carlo simulations
3. Plot probability distributions

Example:
```python
# Add to any model
import numpy as np

n_simulations = 1000
results = []

for i in range(n_simulations):
    # Vary key parameters
    UA_value = np.random.normal(111.7, 15)  # ¬±15 W/K uncertainty
    electric_rate = np.random.uniform(0.12, 0.20)
    
    # Run model with varied parameters
    result = run_model(UA_value, electric_rate)
    results.append(result)

# Analyze distribution
mean_payback = np.mean([r['payback'] for r in results])
percentile_90 = np.percentile([r['payback'] for r in results], 90)
```

## üìö Understanding the Models

### Model Validation Status

| Component | Validation Level | Evidence |
|:----------|:-----------------|:---------|
| **SAT Chemistry** | Literature ‚ö†Ô∏è | 30+ years research, NOT tested in ITB-100 |
| **Heat Transfer** | Calculated ‚ö†Ô∏è | Based on thermal resistance equations |
| **Solar Charging** | Modeled ‚ö†Ô∏è | Evacuated tube performance curves |
| **Economics** | Estimated ‚ö†Ô∏è | Based on analogous products |
| **Market Size** | Projected ‚ö†Ô∏è | Industry analyst reports |

**Key:** ‚ùå No validation | ‚ö†Ô∏è Theoretical only | ‚úÖ Experimentally validated

### Sources of Uncertainty

**High Uncertainty (¬±50%+):**
- Manufacturing cost at volume (no quotes)
- Market penetration rate (optimistic?)
- Equipment life extension value

**Medium Uncertainty (¬±20-30%):**
- Heat transfer coefficient (UA value)
- Solar charging efficiency (weather-dependent)
- Economic value assumptions

**Low Uncertainty (¬±10%):**
- SAT latent heat (well-established)
- Basic thermal dynamics
- Energy storage capacity

### Sensitivity Analysis

Most sensitive parameters (change output by >20%):

1. **Electric rate** (heat pump analysis)
   - +$0.05/kWh ‚Üí Improves payback by ~5 years

2. **Manufacturing cost** (all models)
   - +50% ‚Üí Increases payback by ~10 years

3. **Cycle life** (all models)
   - -50% cycles ‚Üí Doubles levelized cost

4. **Heat transfer coefficient** (system model)
   - -20% UA ‚Üí Reduces power output by ~20%

## üêõ Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations

1. **No uncertainty quantification**
   - All outputs are point estimates
   - No confidence intervals

2. **Location-specific**
   - Hardcoded for Syracuse, NY
   - Requires manual editing for other locations

3. **No time-series simulation**
   - Single-cycle analysis only
   - Doesn't model year-long operation

4. **Simplified economics**
   - Doesn't account for:
     - Electric rate escalation
     - Discount rates
     - Inflation
     - Tax implications (beyond ITC)

5. **No degradation modeling**
   - Assumes constant performance over 10 years
   - Real systems degrade over time

### Planned Improvements

See [COMPLETION_CHECKLIST.md](COMPLETION_CHECKLIST.md) for planned enhancements:

- [ ] Add command-line location selection
- [ ] Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis
- [ ] Time-series simulation (hourly, annual)
- [ ] Degradation models
- [ ] Unit tests
- [ ] Jupyter notebook tutorials
