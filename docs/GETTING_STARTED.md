## ü§î Which Path Is Right for You?

### Path 1: üî¨ **Researcher / Student** (Validate the Science)

**Best if:**
- You have access to lab equipment (DSC, thermocouples, data logger)
- You're interested in phase-change materials or thermal storage
- You want data for a thesis, paper, or research project
- You have ~$200 budget and 4-6 weeks

**Start here:**
1. Read the [Validation Test Protocol](VALIDATION_TEST.md)
2. Order materials (~$180)
3. Build single-cell test rig
4. Run 50-cycle test over 4 weeks
5. Report results (positive or negative!)

**What you'll learn:**
- Does SAT chemistry work as claimed?
- Is electrochemical nucleation reliable?
- How does thermal performance compare to model?
- What are the failure modes?

**Time commitment:** ~40 hours over 4-6 weeks

### Path 2: üõ†Ô∏è **DIY Builder / Maker** (Build Full System)

**Best if:**
- You have metal fabrication skills (TIG welding, machining)
- You have shop access and tools
- You want thermal storage for your own home
- You have ~$3,500 budget and can dedicate weekends

**Start here:**
1. Read the full [technical documentation](models/ITB100_MODEL_DOCUMENTATION.md)
2. Review the [Bill of Materials](docs/BOM.md) *(to be created)*
3. Consider doing single-cell test first (recommended)
4. Build full system following [assembly guide](docs/assembly-guide.md) *(to be created)*
5. Install and monitor for 12+ months

**What you'll gain:**
- 16.7 kWh thermal storage system
- Real-world performance data
- Bragging rights as an early builder
- Contribution to building electrification

**Time commitment:** ~60 hours build + ongoing monitoring

- You can do CAD modeling, FEA, or CFD analysis
- You want to optimize the design before anyone builds it
- You have access to simulation software

**Start here:**
1. Review the [system model code](models/itb100_system_model.py)
2. Study the [design documentation](models/ITB100_MODEL_DOCUMENTATION.md)
3. Identify improvement opportunities:
   - Heat exchanger geometry optimization
   - Alternative PCM formulations
   - Cost reduction strategies
   - Manufacturing process improvements

**Contributions needed:**

- You're looking for products in the building electrification space
- You have capital and want to bring this to market

**Start here:**
1. Review the [market analysis](analysis/EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY_PRODUCT_VIABILITY.md)
2. Study the competitive landscape (Sunamp, Steffes, etc.)
3. Get manufacturing quotes for 100/1,000/10,000 units
4. Build prototype for validation
5. Pursue UL certification if viable

**Questions to answer:**
- Can we hit $1,500 manufacturing cost at 1,000 units/year?
- What's the real market size (validate my TAM estimates)?
- Who are the right distribution partners?
- What's the certification timeline and cost?

**Next steps:**
- Contact me for collaboration discussion
- Build prototype with your manufacturing process
- Test market demand with HVAC installers

**Time commitment:** 6-12 month product development cycle

### Path 5: üè° **Homeowner** (Understand If This Solves Your Problem)

**Best if:**
- You have high heating costs (propane, oil, electric)
- You're considering a heat pump installation
- You're in a gas ban state (NY, CA, etc.)
- You want to understand if thermal storage makes sense

**Start here:**
1. Read the [use case analysis](analysis/HEAT_PUMP_ASSIST_SUMMARY.md)
2. Check if you match one of the target customer segments:
   - Cold climate heat pump owner
   - All-electric new construction
   - High TOU rate spread
   - Existing solar thermal system
3. Run the economic model for your location
4. Decide if you want to wait for commercial product or DIY

**Questions to ask:**
- What's my current heating cost per kWh?
- Do I have TOU electric rates? (Peak vs. off-peak spread?)
- Am I planning a heat pump installation?
- Do I have solar thermal collectors?

**If economics work for you:**
- Watch this project for builder results
- Contact local HVAC contractors about thermal storage
- Consider DIY build if you have skills

**Time commitment:** 2-3 hours research

### Path 6: üåç **Supporter** (Help Without Building)

**Best if:**
- You believe in building decarbonization
- You want to support open-source hardware
- You don't have time/skills to build but want to contribute
- You have connections or resources to share

**How to help:**
1. **‚≠ê Star the repository** (helps others discover it)
2. **Share the project** with relevant communities:
   - Building science forums
   - HVAC professional groups
   - Heat pump owner communities
   - University engineering departments
3. **Connect builders with resources:**
   - Know a contract manufacturer? Introduce them.
   - Know a thermal storage researcher? Share the project.
   - Have access to testing equipment? Offer it to builders.
4. **Provide feedback** on documentation (Is anything unclear?)
5. **Translate** documentation to other languages

**Time commitment:** 1-2 hours + ongoing as interested

## üö¶ Project Status Check

Before diving in, understand where we are:

| Stage | Status | What This Means |
|:------|:------:|:----------------|
| **Design** | ‚úÖ Complete | CAD models, thermal model, BOM all done |
| **Analysis** | ‚úÖ Complete | Economics, market sizing, use cases analyzed |
| **Validation** | ‚è≥ Seeking builders | Need 3-5 people to test single-cell |
| **Prototype** | ‚è≥ Waiting | Full system build after validation |
| **Field Testing** | ‚è≥ Pending | 12-month monitoring after prototype |
| **Certification** | ‚ùå Not started | UL/CSA testing (if commercialized) |

**Translation:** The design is ready, but it's **unproven**. We need builders to validate core assumptions before anyone should invest $3,500 in a full system.

**Recommended:** Start with Path 1 (single-cell test) unless you're very risk-tolerant.
